my system is Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS

most of my methods have documents that explain what 
they do.
i didn't write comments on codes that doesn't seem complicated
to me.

5.1 is answerd by 5.2 python theme file and python syntax file.

5.3 my favorite language is java so java.syntax and java.theme

i have mymodul.py which i use to import methods that can be 
reused.
