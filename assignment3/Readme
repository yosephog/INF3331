--: My script can be runed as stated in the assignment.
  wc.py can be run in three ways 
  python wc.py myfile
  python wc.py *
  python wc.py *.py
 the assignment stated that the word,line and space count should be in a
single line. but i made it in a way little readable. it displays the file
name that is read,the counts and everything in a readable way.

  complex.py can be run normally by
   python complex.py
  i have a couple of test at the bottom that i have used to check my functions.

  test_complex.py can be runed as
   pytest test_complex.py

ps-: there are a lot of commants in my file that are not necessary. but it was
stated in the assignment to comment them and that is why.
