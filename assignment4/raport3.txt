for my input values i have used the following
xmin=-2
xmax=0.5
ymin=-1.25
ymax=1.25
width=1000
height=1000
maxiter=100

the time it take for numpy is 3.746
the time it take for python is 8.836372
the time it take for numba is 0,664

the timing is well decreased and it was very fast using numba.

the advantage of using numba is that my code was simpler and
easier while my numpy code uses way too much numpy modules.

the time is way faster than numpy when using numba.

the disadvantage of numba without using numpy is that array
manuplation becomes tedious and time consuming.
