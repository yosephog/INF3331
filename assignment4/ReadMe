i have a my_modul.py file that contains all the function that
i have implemented. this help me when comparing between python and numpy.

but above all i used it for my mandelbrot.py. the script only have the
argument parser and it calls on the function/methods from the my_modul.py

i have a brief explanation of things that i have assumed mainly on the 
test_mandelbrot.py

i have uploded the package for setup.py with the __init__.py and 
compute_mandelbrot.py. since my setup.py have a package name i thought
it would be necessary.
